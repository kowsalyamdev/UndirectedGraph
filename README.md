# UndirectedGraph

## Question 1

Use the following undirected graph ­- nodes can be visited only once:

<div align="center">
    <img src="assets/graph.png" width="300px"</img>
     </div>

- a. Write a function that returns all the possible paths between A­-H.
- b. Write a function that returns the least number of hops (shortest path) between A­-H.

## For above functions:

- findAllPaths: This function uses a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find all the possible paths between the start node ('A') and the end node ('H') in the given undirected graph.

- findShortestPath: This function uses a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between the start node ('A') and the end node ('H') in the given undirected graph.

## Steps for setup:

## way-1.

Use Visual studio code editor for test this code by run option.

## way-2.

Use Terminal and open the file location and run command as "javac UndirectedGraph.java"
